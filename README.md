# Asteroids Remake

Author: Ian Caio

## Description

A Asteroids remake made in Ruby (with Gtk3 and Cairo) to practice Ruby coding and OOP paradigm.

## How to play

Use 'W' and 'S' to accelerate the ship forward or backwards.
Use 'A' and 'D' to turn the ship.
Use 'space' to shoot.

Initially there are 10 asteroids, being 5 large and 5 medium sized.
You can run over the bullets you have shot without losing, but you can't hit any asteroid.
The score starts at 1 million and decreases with time, so the faster you win, higher the score.
The 10 best scores are kept in a HighScore file (You will be prompted for a name if your score is amongst
the 10 best ones)

Destroy all asteroids to win!
